Title: Lab Assignment 01 - AWS S3 Secure Website Hosting Student Details: Setika Munjal, 2301410029

S3 Bucket Website URL: http://setika-munjal-03052005.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/
Implementation Steps: Create S3 Bucket Sign in to the AWS Console > S3 > Create bucket Used a unique name (aman-yadav-17-05-2005), choose region mumbai ap-south-1, keep defaults, and create the bucket. Upload two HTML files: index.html (homepage with your name/ID) error.html (user-friendly 404 page). Enable Static Hosting In bucket Properties > Static website hosting, enable it. Set, Index document = index.html Error document = error.html Save and note the endpoint Configure Public Access In Permissions > Block public access, disable "Block all public access." Add a bucket policy (in bucket-policy.json) to allow public read. Test the Website Visiting the endpoint should now load index.html. Accessing a non-existent path should show error.html.
Bucket Policy: { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": "", "Action": "s3:GetObject", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aman-yadav-17-05-2005/" } ] }
IAM Policy: { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "AllowListBucket", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "s3:ListBucket", "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aman-yadav-17-05-2005" }, { "Sid": "AllowObjectActions", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aman-yadav-17-05-2005/*" } ] } Create a custom IAM policy that allows only listing the bucket and putting, getting, or deleting objects—but strictly within your specific S3 bucket. This adheres to least-privilege principles. Create the IAM user (s3-website-manager) with console access in the IAM dashboard. Attach the custom policy directly, ensuring they only manage the website bucket. Download the credentials CSV after creation and store it securely this avoids using root access.
CloudTrail Configuration & Logs: Set up a CloudTrail trail named (S3-Website-Activity-Log) and direct logs into a new, separate S3 bucket—this avoids infinite logging loops. Enable both management and object-level (data) events, ensuring reads/writes (like GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject) are logged.
